Project brief was to create a database for the hotel using the datasets provided. Then perform some exporatory data analysis on the data to answer some key statkeholder questions. 
1. Is the company turning a profit every year?
2. If so, which specific hotels are making profit?
3. Should we increase our parking lot size?
4. What trends can we see in the data? 

The first two questions were answered using some SQL queries, then the data was transfered to Microsoft power BI for further analysis and visualization. The last two questions were then answered.
